Martha Release Checklist
=========

Martha's release process is documented and tracked through a Jira checklist. 

Martha is updated rarely enough that we typically include a release in the 
work of each ticket. Navigate to the ticket associated with the work you're 
releasing, or create a new ticket for the release. In the Jira ticket, click 
on Add Checklist, then click on the button with three dots in the upper right 
of the checklist widget. Select Load Templates -> Martha Release Checklist. 
Perform the steps documented in the checklist, checking each off as you go.
