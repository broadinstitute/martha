# NOTE: If editing this file then check if cleanup of docker/Dockerfile is needed also!

# We actually upgrade libbsd0 in docker/Dockerfile so the image should
# not be vulnerable for this CVE.
#
# However, trivy thinks there is no fix available in Debian-buster,
# so trivy sees buster+libbsd0 and thinks "it must still be vulnerable".
